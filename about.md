I'm   <font size =5pt> HaoYun Yao</font>   from Taiwan. I earned my bachlor and master degree at National Taiwan university under the supervision by <a href="https://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~mlhsieh/" target="_blank"> Ming-Lun Hsieh</a>.

From 2023 fall I started my ph.D in mathematics at Duke university, and is now a third year. My advisor is  <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/jgetz/"  target="_blank"> Jayce R. Get</a>.


<!-- Currently working on constructing a non-abelian (pre)trace formula whose spectral side is indexed by cusipidal automorphic representations that are invariant under a simple non-abelian Galois group action (hence the name, in contrast to solvable Galois group). More (but not much) information on this idea can be found in <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/trtnatr/"> here</a>.
