title: $\ell$-adic sheaves toward exponential sums
---

# Student Seminar on $l$
---

The goal is to familarize ourselves with $\ell$-adic sheaves and perverse sheaves (complex or $\ell$-adic). The final goals are two-fold: 

1. understand Deligne's proof of Weil conjecture/Riemann hypothesis for function fields, and

2. understand cohomological interpretation of exponential sums.

This is not the Weil conjecture we are aiming to understand, but the Weil conjecture on the Tamagawa number. Nevertheless, the chapters 2, 3 contain a $\infty$-categorical way of constructing the category of $\ell$-adic sheaves, which seems to be neater than the classical way. A caveat: they in the book require the scheme to be quasi-projective, but most of the results should remain true in the algebraic scheme under some dimension assumption.
